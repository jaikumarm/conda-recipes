# build:
  # noarch_python: True
  # preserve_egg_dir: True
  # entry_points:
    # Put any entry points (scripts to be generated automatically) here. The
    # syntax is module:function.  For example
    #
    # - networkx = networkx:main
    #
    # Would create an entry point called networkx that calls networkx.main()


  # If this is a new build for the same version, increment the build
  # number. If you do not include this key, it defaults to 0.
